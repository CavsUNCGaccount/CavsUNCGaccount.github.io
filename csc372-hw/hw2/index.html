        <p>
            Welcome to Granny's Pie! We are a small and family owned business
            <br>
            based in Burlington, North Carolina. Here you will find a lemon pie
            recipe <br>
            so delicious that it has won the in the top 3 spot of the <br>
            National Pie Championship 4 years in a row! It is our classic lemon
            meringue pie recipe! <br>
            This recipe was created by Granny, the founder of the business. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Drinks that go well with the lemon meringue pie</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Coffee: Nothing beats a classic cup of joe.</li>
            <li>Milk: Plain milk always goes well with a sweet dessert</li>
            <li>Chocolate milk: If you want to try something else other than
                plain milk, you can't go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>Cappucino: If you want the best of both coffee and milk, then
                cappucino is the drink for you.</li>
            <li>Lemonade: It only makes sense to drink a lemon based
                refreshment along with a lemon based dessert! Try it if
                you want a nice change from coffee or milk based drinks.</li>

        </ul>
